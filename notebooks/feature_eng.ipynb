Contamos com features de série temporal e features categóricas, que vão ajudar o modelo a aprender características associadas ao pdv e ao produto; Espera-se que o modelo, ao receber em avaliação um novo par pdv-produto, consiga através das features categóricas gerar uma boa predição. Ou seja, o modelo olha para as características da loja e produto para se contextualizar, e então usa features de time series para identificar um padrão dentro desse contexto. (Hipótese)"
